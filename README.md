# Funqy Workflows üöÄ

Welcome to the **Funqy Workflows Workshop**!  Presented by the Red Hat Launch Team!

This repository showcases how to build **event-driven, serverless applications** using [Quarkus Funqy](https://quarkus.io/guides/funqy) with **Knative Events** on OpenShift.  

Each workflow demonstrates how **CloudEvents** move through multiple chained functions (using `configChain` mappings or `@CloudEventMapping` annotations), modeling real-world processes across different industries.
